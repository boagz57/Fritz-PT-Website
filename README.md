# Fritz-PT-Website

This is the code from my first and only official website that I created from scratch for my old boss. He had this site up for about 4 years but has since migrated to a new site given I no longer do web development. While I left web development behind, I still have found memories of it as it was my introduction into the world of programming and it left me wanting more.....much much more.
